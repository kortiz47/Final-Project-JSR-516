Welcome to the A&E Handyman Promotional Website!

- This website is meant to promote the projects that have been done by A&E Handyman
- The page should explain what projects have been done, the company philosophy, and also includes a contact form
- Upon submission to the contact form, the data will be saved as a JSON object in the contactsData.json file that can be seen on the backen of the application
- You are able to navigate to different pages


Things that will be added in the future:
- A recaptcha feature on the form so that the website is protected from bots
- Link to a larger database and something more secure so that data is protected
- Create an internal page that requires a login to acces the contact information that is submitted on the form that will be displayed to the user
- More features and time spent on CSS styling
- Create and add the projects, about us, services, and gallery pages
- Add custom art, a logo, and a favicon
